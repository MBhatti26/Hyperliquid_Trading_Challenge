# Instructions:
1. Add an @abstractmethod to `src/core/base.py for each endpoint`
2. Define an async function at `src/infrastructure/public_hl_datasource.py`
  * I believe all function logic will be in this file as well
  * However, it might be worth creating a global calculations file to handle complex equations and logic
3. Create an api file in the `src/api` folder
  * This could also be where function logic is handled
  * This is definitely where you shape the output
4. If you needed to download any more Python packages, please add to `requirements.txt`
5. Wallet and builder addresses should be in the `.env` file. Please refer to the README for how to set that up. Below shows what to add to your api files to access the variables in `.env`:
```
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
<!-- Or other variable name -->
TARGET_BUILDER = os.getenv("TARGET_BUILDER")
```
